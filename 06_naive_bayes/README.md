### Before

Read Paul Graham's [Plan for Spam](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html).

Optional: Explore more from Paul Graham with, for example, [Better Bayesian Filtering](http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html).


### Questions

 * You want to use KNN with a training set to eventually make predictions on new data. How will you choose K?
 * "I have three cards: one is black on both sides, one is red on both sides, and one is black on one side and red on the other. I pick a card at random out of a hat and look at one side only. It is black. What is the probability that the other side is black?" (This question is used by Gelman in his Bayesian Data Analysis class at Columbia.)
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?


### During

### After

implement naive bayes in R
