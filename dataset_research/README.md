# Dataset Research

This homework will introduce you to a dataset - and give you something to work with in `R`. You aren't limited to just the dataset you work with here, but it will give you something to start from. Becoming familiar with a dataset is an important first step; those included in the [starter list of datasets](datasets.md) are fairly small and well known. Many are already included in `R` or an `R` package that you can easily find.

You should write a markdown file covering the following:

 * What are the structure and contents of your dataset? (Number of records, columns, missing values, etc.)
 * What is the history of your dataset (How was it created?)
 * Has your dataset been written about? What have others used it for?
 * How do you acquire and load the dataset into `R`? (Include code.)
 * What are some simple statistics describing the dataset?

For datasets already available in `R`, don't neglect to check the included documentation! (`?dataset_name`)

How do you know you're done?

 * You have a markdown file in the class repository `dataset_research` folder, including the above.
