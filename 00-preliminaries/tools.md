# Get comfortable with tools


This document helps you get up to speed with three tool families:

 * Command Line Interface (CLI) tools, organized around the `bash` shell and `git` for version control.
 * The `R` statistical programming environment.
 * The `python` programming language.

For each, you can go as deep as you need to feel comfortable:

 * Installing the software. This is the bare minimum to have the tools available.
 * A gentle introduction. This is typically an in-browser interactive which assumes no prior knowledge.
 * A deeper dive. These provide much more exposition and extend to advanced topics.


## `bash` and `git`

### Install

 * If you’re running Mac OS X, `bash` is what you have by default in `Terminal`. You should [install homebrew](http://brew.sh/#install). Then `brew install git`.
 * If you’re running Windows, you should [install Git Bash](http://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash).
 * If you’re running Linux, you run `bash` or know better, and can install `git`.

### Gentle Introduction

 * If you haven’t used a command line interface like `bash`, try [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). Ignore the stuff about PowerShell.
 * If you haven't used `git`, [Try Git](http://try.github.io/) will teach you the basics in 15 minutes, in your browser. For a little more explanation, check out Atlassian's [Git Basics](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics) and other tutorials.

### Deeper Dive

 * [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://writers.fultus.com/garrels/ebooks/Machtelt_Garrels_Bash_Guide_for_Beginners_2nd_Ed.pdf)
 * [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book)


## `R`

### Install

 * Install the appropriate `R` distribution for your system from this [mirror](http://watson.nci.nih.gov/cran_mirror/).
 * Install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop) for `R`. The RStudio site should suggest an appropriate package for your system.

### Gentle Introduction

 * If you're not familiar with `R`, the [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) tutorial will take you through an interactive introductory course of an hour or so, all in your browser.

### Deeper Dive

* [Advanced R Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)


## `python`

### Install

 * You really want the Anaconda `python` distribution. [Download and install](http://continuum.io/downloads) as appropriate for your system.

### Gentle Introduction

 * If you haven't used `python`, the in-browser interactive [tutorials from Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) aren't bad. They take some time to go through; skip the projects if you want to just work through the syntax.

### Deeper Dive

 * [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf)
     * This one starts out very basic but eventually includes some sophisticated general ideas about programming.
 * [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
     * This is probably the most popular intro to `python`, with a very distinctive voice, from the same author as the Command Line Crash Course, above.
