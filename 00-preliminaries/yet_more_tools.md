### Yet More Tool References

These are not my first choices, but they are additional references that you might consider if you dislike those in [tools](tools.md).

For `R`:

 * [swirlstats](http://swirlstats.com/) is an interactive intro to `R`, _in_ `R`.
 * If you like video, you may quite enjoy Google's [Intro to R](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP) series, and/or these [two-minute `R` tutorials](http://www.twotorials.com/).
 * [R: A self-learn tutorial](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf)
 * Germán Rodríguez' [Introducing R](http://data.princeton.edu/R/)

For `python`:
 * [Try Python](http://www.trypython.org/) is an old-ish but possibly worthwhile interactive intro to python in the browser.
 * [Learn Python](http://www.learnpython.org/) is a newer interactive in-browser python offering, which is probably nice if you don't mind their UI style.
